1.  Introduction

   The goal of this draft is two-fold: it tries to document lessons
   learned in deploying SCION to some if its productive early adopters,
   and it tries to tries to answer questions 2.7 - Operating a Path-
   Aware Network, and 2.8 - Deploying a Path-Aware Network posed in
   [RFC9217].

   *Note:* This is the very first version of the SCION deployment draft,
   and it merely contains a skeleton of potential topics to be further
   discussed in this draft.  Any feedback is welcome and much
   appreciated.  Thanks!

   *  This draft assumes the reader is familiar with the overall core
      SCION specification, outlined in [I-D.scion-dataplane],
      [I-D.scion-cppki], [I-D.scion-cp].

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.
