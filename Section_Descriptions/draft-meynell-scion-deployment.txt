1.  Introduction

   *  Problem statement.

   *  Refer to the PKI, Control Plane and Data Plane Internet Drafts
      here.

   *  Mention we try to answer 2.7 - Operating a Path-Aware Network, and
      2.8 - Deploying a Path-Aware Network of rfc9217.

2.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Deployment Models

3.1.  SCION Network - How to roll it out.

   ## SCION-IP Gateway & IP in SCION tunneling for ecosystems (see
   Anapaya IETF118 presentation) ## SCION-enabled Applications ##
   Implications for the transport layer (section 2.5 of rfc9217)

4.  Establishing and running an Isolation Domain

   *(see SIX presentation IETF118 -
   https://datatracker.ietf.org/meeting/118/materials/slides-118-panrg-
   scion-deployment-experience-the-secure-swiss-finance-network-ssfn)*

4.1.  Description and use case

4.2.  Governance

4.3.  Core Members - TRC signers

4.4.  Issuing Members - issuers of AS certifications (may be the same as
      Core Members)

4.5.  Non-Core Members (is this the correct term - should we define a
      better term?)

4.6.  Coordination

4.7.  Required contact information

4.8.  Methods of Communication and Authentication requirements

4.9.  ISD Policy Development & Maintenance

4.10.  Assignment and registration of ISD numbers

4.11.  Assignment and registration of SCION AS numbers

4.12.  Trust Root Configuration

   *  TRC signing

   *  TRC distribution & installation

   *  Maintaining cryptographic material

   *  Certificate issuance

4.13.  Security Incident Handling - this could go into the Security
       section

5.  Establishing and running a SCION network

5.1.  Prerequisites - e.g.  AS number, running existing intra-domain
      protocol if applicable

   ## How to join an ISD ## Obtaining an SCION AS number and AS
   certificate ## Setting up the Control Services (Beacon, Path and
   Certificate servers) ## Availability & scalability ## Setting up
   SCION border routers ## Customer site deployment (native, SCION-IP
   gateway, SCION-enabled application) ## Configuring path (segment)
   attributes/parameters (and how do customers select paths) - this
   could be a separate section ## SCION & Network Address Translation ##
   Software Change Management

6.  Adding and removing networks from an Isolation Doman

6.1.  Adding a new Core network

   ## Removing an existing Core network ## Changes between existing Core
   networks ## Adding a new non-Core network ## Removing an existing
   non-Core network ## Changes between Core network and non-core network

7.  Connecting to other Isolation Domains

   *There doesn't seem to be much/any documentation on what needs to be
   done to set-up inter-ISD communication, or how AS ‘peering’ works
   across different ISDs.*

   *  Inter-ISD Governance (is this applicable?)

   *  Inter-ISD Policy Development & Maintenance

   *  Inter-ISD Path selection

8.  SCION-IP Gateway Deployment

   *Is this section needed for this Internet Draft?  Could it go in the
   ‘Adding and removing networks from an Isolation Domain’ section?*

9.  End Host Deployment

   *Is this section needed for this Internet Draft?  Could it go in the
   ‘Adding and removing networks from an Isolation Domain’ section?*

10.  Performance Monitoring

   *This is outlined in the 'Best Practices for SCION ISD Operations but
   is this strictly needed for an Internet Draft?  Most/all networks
   should be monitored as a matter of good operational practice, and
   unless SCION networks need to meet stated parameters, is this section
   actually required?*

11.  Security Considerations

   TODO Security

12.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
